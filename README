tonemap
-------

Program Description:
    The program takes an image and a filter specified by [filter].filt and calculates
    a convolution of the filter on the specified image.

Compilation:
    $> make

Use Cases:
    $> ./tonemap ['-c' or '-g' need to use one] gamma_value input.img

    - Displays the input image with tone map applied in an opengl window
    - Press 's' or 'S' to flip between a non tone mapped image and tone mapped image

    $> ./tonemap ['-c' or '-g' need to use one] gamma_value input.img output.img

    - same functionality as above except 'w' writes the image in the opengl
      window to output.img

Description of flags:
    Valid flag options are: [-g] for simple tonemap and [-c] which convolves the log-space
    luminance into a blurred channel and sharpened channel S,and recomposes them as gamma * B + S

Known Bugs:
    -

Boundary Handling (for convolution of luminance map):
    - Sets luminance values that lie outside of the image boundaries to black.
      That is luminance = 0.0
    - This is handled in the calculateFilterMap.


Additional Information:
    - Nothing in the advanced section is implemented.
