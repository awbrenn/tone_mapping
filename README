tonemap
-------

Program Description:
    The program takes an image and a filter specified by [filter].filt and calculates
    a convolution of the filter on the specified image.

Compilation:
    $> make

Use Cases:
    $> ./tonemap ['-c' or '-g' need to use one] gamma_value input.img

    - Displays the input image with tone map applied in an opengl window
    - Press 's' or 'S' to flip between a non tone mapped image and tone mapped image

    $> ./tonemap ['-c' or '-g' need to use one] gamma_value input.img output.img

    - same functionality as above except 'w' writes the image in the opengl
      window to output.img

Best Submitted Images:
    - The best images that i created can be found in the images folder. The two images are the following:
         - Best_Simple_Tone_Map.png
         - Best_Tone_Map_with_Convolution_Output.png

    - I used a gamma value of 0.45 for both of these images
    - The images can be reproduced by following the use case examples above with 0.45 set for the gamma

Description of flags:
    - Valid flag options are: [-g] for simple tonemap and [-c] which convolves the log-space
      luminance into a blurred channel and sharpened channel S,and recomposes them as gamma * B + S

Known Bugs:
    - Something is wrong with images with a very high dynamic range. It is very noticeable in the
      smalldesignCenter.hdr image. Hardly anything is visible and I don't know why.

    - There is an artifact where pixels are assigned bizarre values. It is noticible in the Ocean.exr
      in the bottom left corner.

    - Program seg faults when writing to hdr images. I think this is an OIIO problem with writing a four
      channel image to an hdr format.

Boundary Handling (for convolution of luminance map):
    - Sets luminance values that lie outside of the image boundaries to black.
      That is luminance = 0.0
    - This is handled in the calculateFilterMap.

Additional Information:
    - Nothing in the advanced section is implemented.
